# Weekly report 4

[Hour reporting](/documentation/hours.md)

## Overall status

The project is in an acceptable state. I have implemented echo hiding but lack the capability to decode messages. That is my next and only goal for the rest of this project (apart from an UI.)

I continue to be tired, and despite advancements in the core of the project, things like testing and documentation have stagnated.

## What did I do this week?

Implemented echo hiding. Pretty nifty, but I have one weakness - I need to test the system with additional audio files.

## What did I struggle with?

Time management and testing. I can come up with tests, and I'm fairly sure they test approximately what they should test, but I'm having a hard time coming up with high-quality testing ideas.

## Next steps

- Steganalysis allowing the detection and  decoding of echo hiding messages
- Testing the effect of echo hiding on audio quality in comparison to LSB
- Making sure the program can handle wav files in general, and not just my test data
- UI to allow easy use

Finally, IF I have the time, I'll try to do implement Fourier transforms. But I'll only get there if I get there.
