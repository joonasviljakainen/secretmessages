# Weekly report #1

[Hour reporting](/documentation/hours.md)

## What did I do this week?

I set up the project and selected a topic. I struggled with some really basic things (project setup and git), which I felt was frustrating, but really it's just part of the cycle.

## What is my status?

I've set up the project structure. I have implemented nothing yet, but I'll start with disk I/O and some further reading on manipulating WAV files.

## What have I learned? 

I've learned a bunch about WAV files, although I still need to implement my learning in practice. I've seen that least-bit 

## What are my struggles?

Topic selection and scope - I'm not sure whether I have enough doing just LSB, but echo hiding is quite complicated and I could end up swamped by all the details. There's a lot of maths involved, which is not my strong suit.

__Question:__ Is LSB itself enough for passing the course, i.e. could I work on LSB and feel confident about passing, and then do what I can towards echo hiding or possibly added encryption with LSB?

## Next:

1. I will further analyze the algorithms, to get a better understanding of what is needed.
2. I will implement I/O. Without the ability to read and write to disk, there is no way further the actual algorithms.
3. I will implement the necessary classes for processing WAV files as Java classes.
4. Basic LSB should be possible by the end of week 2 (although maybe that's a bit optimistic?)
5. I will evaluate the amount of work done, time left, and try to rethink the scope of the work - in other words, with more info I'm better able to decide what I can do in these 6-7 weeks.
