# Weekly report 6

[Hour reporting](/documentation/hours.md)

## Overall status

I had less time to use for this project than I planned, and things haven't progressed as hoped. 

1. I may not be able to use my own natural logarithm. I've tried a few things, but none are as fast or accurate as required.
2. Fourier transformations are out of bounds for good.


## What did I do this week?

I kept hacking the UI together. It's ugly, but it (mostly) works. I tried to create an algorithm for natural logarithms, but while I was able to generate relatively accurate approximations, they were neither accurate nor fast enough for this project.

## What did I struggle with?

Logarithms, UI, pretty much everything I did this week.

## Next steps

- Finish the UI
- Prepare for the demo
- Acquire test data and do performance testing.
