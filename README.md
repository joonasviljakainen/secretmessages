# Secretmessages

A project for TiraLabra.

## Purpose

The aim of this project is to hide data/messages in audio files. 

### Algorithms
 
 __Least-Significant Bit__ encoding will be used in one form or other.
  There is time, so I will try to implement an __Echo Hiding__ algorithm for watermarking audio files.

  The point, of course, is to also be able to recover the messages from the audio files.

### Target Data

This project will target Microsoft WAV files, as they are a simple starting point.
