# Secretmessages

A project for TiraLabra 

## Purpose

The aim of this project is to hide data/messages in audio files. 

### Algorithms
 
 Least-Significant Bit encoding will be used in one form or other.
  If there is time, I would like to try to implement an Echo Hiding algorithm for watermarking audio files.

### Target Data

This project will target Microsoft WAV files, as they are a simple starting point.
